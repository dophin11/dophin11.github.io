      <p> I used Ohm's law to calculate the appropriate resistors to keep 
        the current under 40mA, which is the maximum output from the Arduino.
         Based on the calculations, any resistor greater than 125 ohms would work. 
         However, to minimize current draw and conserve battery life, I chose a 10k ohm resistor. 
         The voltage readings are expected to vary between 2.5V and 5V, as the 
         photoresistor can range from 0 to 10k ohms.

      <h2>operation of the circuit</h2>
        <p>
            Based on the readings from the photoresistor, the LED behavior changes according to the light conditions:

            Low Light: The blue LED will turn on, and the RGB LED will display a specific color calculated from the reading value.
            Medium Light: The green LED will turn on, and the RGB LED will fade into another color based on the calculated reading.
            High Light: The red LED will turn on, and the RGB LED will fade into yet another color determined by the light level.
            This setup dynamically adjusts the LED colors and behavior to reflect the surrounding light conditions.
