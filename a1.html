      <h2>Calculation and Schematic</h2>
      <img src = "calculation.png"/>
      <p> I used Ohm's law to perform the calculations, to pick the resistor so that the current is under 20mA</p>

      <h2>Circuit</h2>
      <img src="circuit.png"/>
      <h2>Answer to the questions</h2>
        <p>3 graphs shown for 3 LED:</p>
        <img src = "graph1.png"/>
        <img src = "graph2.png"/>
        <img src = "graph3.png"/>
        <p> they open and close at different rates, when they are on, the voltage is 1.8V, when they are off it is 0V</p>
        <p>The Arduino have 14 GPIO ports, so I can have 14 LEDs that blink independently
          for each LED(red) the current that passes through when it's light is on is 14.5mA so for
          14 LEDs, the max current would be 203mA, however, we do need to check the maximum current that Arduino can operate
          safely.
        </p>
        <p>I wasnt able to tell that it is blinking at 12ms</p>
      <h2>operation of the circuit</h2>
        <img src="circuit.gif"/>
        <p>below is the code snippet:</p>
        <pre>
        <code>
          /*
  Blink

  Turns an LED on for one second, then off for one second, repeatedly.

  Most Arduinos have an on-board LED you can control. On the UNO, MEGA and ZERO
  it is attached to digital pin 13, on MKR1000 on pin 6. LED_BUILTIN is set to
  the correct LED pin independent of which board is used.
  If you want to know what pin the on-board LED is connected to on your Arduino
  model, check the Technical Specs of your board at:
