      <h2>Calculation and Schematic</h2>

      <p> I used Ohm's law to calculate the appropriate resistors to keep the current 
        under 20mA for all LEDs. Based on my calculations, the closest fit was a 220Ω 
        resistor for the red, yellow, and green LEDs, and a 100Ω resistor for the blue 
        LED. However, when I tested the 100Ω resistor with the blue LED, the resulting 
        brightness was uncomfortably high. To ensure a more balanced and comfortable brightness, 
        I decided to use 220Ω resistors for all the LEDs.
        The resistance of the push button is really small, so I used the 10KΩ resistor
        for the push button as indicated in the schematics.

      <p>The circuit is build according to the schematics above</p>

      <p>Based on calculations above, my circuit can run at least 13 hours and 47 minutes</p>
      <h2>operation of the circuit</h2>
        <p>
            The button performs four distinct tasks:

            Task 1: Press the button once to turn on all LEDs. The RGB LED will begin fading automatically.
            Task 2: Press the button twice within a 1-second time limit. This means both presses must occur 
            within one second; pressing once and waiting longer (e.g., until the next day) will not count. 
            Completing this action will turn off all lights.
            Task 3: Press the button three times within the 1-second time limit to set the RGB LED to a mixed 
            color. You can customize the color by adjusting the RGB values in the code (ranging from 0 to 255).
            Task 4: Hold the button for more than 0.5 seconds. This will turn off all LEDs except the RGB LED, 
            which will light up and begin fading.
            This design ensures precise control over the LEDs with simple, intuitive interactions.
