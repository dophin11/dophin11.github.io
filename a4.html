      <h2>Schematic</h2>
      <img src = "4schematics.png"/>
      <p> Schematics as shown above, I added a capacitor so the flow is more
        stable. 
      </p>

      <h2>Circuit</h2>
      <img src="4circuit.png"/>
      <p>The circuit is build according to the schematics above</p>
      <h2>Answer to the questions</h2>
      <img src = "4question.png"/>
      <p> For question 1, the servo will move 20 times in 2 seconds since there is a delay
        each degree have different duty cycle, but when measured with a multimeter, the voltage
        really small so the percentage that it is active is really small(5%) and it doesnt change much.
        For question 2, I used averaging method to solve the problem, updating it 20% at a time
        so it is more stable and can average out the error.
        For question 3, I used a different way of averaging, I took 10 readings and average them out, so 
        the noise doesn't bother the system. 
      </p>
      <h2>operation of the circuit</h2>
        <p>
            When your hands move at different distance, the servo will respond by rotating to different degree. 
            It is like a extended robotic arm that will respond according to your movement.

        <p>below is the code snippet:</p>
        <pre>
            <code>
              
                #include <Servo.h>; //import libraries (for Servo)
                    #include <Ultrasonic.h>; //(for ultrasonic sensor)
                    
                    #define TRIGGER_PIN 3 //define pin for trigger and echo (ultrasonic)
                    #define ECHO_PIN 2
                    
                    Servo myServo; //initialize servo
                    Ultrasonic ultrasonic(TRIGGER_PIN, ECHO_PIN); //intitalize ultrasonic
                    long distance_avg = 0;//define distance average to reduce noise
                    
                    
                    void setup() {
                      Serial.begin(9600); //setup serial monitor
                      myServo.attach(7); //set servo pin to 7
                    
                    }
                    void loop() {
                      long distance = ultrasonic.read(); //read distance
                      distance_avg = (0.8 * distance_avg) + (0.2 * distance); //calculate average distanc based on calculation updates
                      distance_avg = constrain(distance_avg, 0, 50); //set constrain so between 0 to 50 cm
                      int distance_map = map(distance_avg, 0, 50, 0, 180); //map distance average to angle of the servo
                      myServo.write(distance_map); //output to servo
                      Serial.println(distance_map); //check reading
                      delay(50); //delay
                    }
